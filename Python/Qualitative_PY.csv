Q1,I would like to see verora mite populations in the area along with other diseases.  Pest and disease management references would also be helpful.
Q1,None that I can think of
Q1,"Group cropping items into clusters of comparable forage quality and code similarly. There are too many categories, and they are not, in any case, accurate in any detail.  Fix the scoring; high should be greater or equal not less or equal. A link to paragraphs that explain the criteria that result in a particular scoring would be most useful. "
Q1,"I'm not sure how the scores are calculated, which leads me to how much I trust the values. The floral scores are important but I would argue the pesticide usage is the most important value to myself. I don't see how this can be accurate. How does beescapes know what chemicals my neighbor is spraying on his yard, it doesn't..."
Q1,"Ability to share information with nearby beekeepers.  For example, regarding bee health, whether or not pollen is being brought in, honey production levels, etc."
Q1,I live in Connecticut so please add my state to Beescape soon.
Q1,"Glossary - what does ""Nesting"" mean in this context? Hollow trees?
The crop cover information is difficult to interpret. Too many of the colors are similar and there's no textual information on the map. Also, the information for the Penn State farm throws the quality of the data into question."
Q1,"I have a hard time distinguishing some of the colors in the crop layer.  I live in a rural/agricultural area, so there's a lot of farms and plant life nearby.  I would love for the crops either to be identified explicitly on the map or the colors to differ enough that I actually know what's available in my area."
Q1,my computer does not allow for drag and click so reording the above preferences was not possible
Q1,"A key for the map that explains what the other blue dots are. 
A layer that shows Spotted Lanternfly infestations, as our bees may be ingesting the honeydew. "
Q1,"I understand that this is in its infancy and will be expanded.  It was interesting to see the results for the categories.  However, there was no explanation of what the categories meant so it was not as useful as it might be if I had more information.  Other extensions would make it a much more useful tool."
Q1,"give more explanation for definitions of each category, including types of insecticides being monitored or included in the data"
Q1,I don't think there's anything wrong with it. I lked it.
Q1,I think the programs's great. I think it will be easier for most beekeeprs.
Q2,I learned that my hive location is better than what I expected.  I thought there was a higher insecticide risk than what was displayed and there was better forage than what I thought.
Q2,"I think this tool has a lot of promise.  The problem is that my apiary is stationary and I don't know of any way to develop an out yard.  For me, once I determine the scores and potentially what I can do to maximize them, I probably won't return to this web site.  That's because the data, for me, will not change.  Therefore, the tool is great.  You just need to determine how to make it more than just a ""one and done"" experience."
Q2,Very easy survey to complete.  I have a much better understanding of the information available through Beescape.
Q2,I would have enjoyed it more if it were for my location.
Q2,"Realize that most of us don't have the option of moving our apiary. This is why I would likely not consult the map often. Also, cropping on a lot of land changes either over the course of a summer or over the course of a few years as many farmers practice rotations."
Q2,"Overall I think this a useful tool. I don't know the evaluation process and how the ""scores"" are vetted for accuracy but I can see this being useful for people that have a range the can select for a hive location. However, MOST people that have <5 acres of ground probably get the same score regardless of the location they select, it just wouldn't be enough area."
Q2,Great effort!  Keep it up
Q2,Nice site. Thank you
Q2,"This is a really, really great tool. I'd love to have broader regional coverage and more detailed seasonal information. Some insight into why the scores are as they are, and if possible some sense of trends or changes in the scores. I may be wrong but the scores for my 265 Port Royal Rd, Philadelphia, PA apiary seem higher than they were the last time I looked. Right now it's very useful for planning where to put an apiary, and it's great. It would be interesting if it could evolve into something that supports management. I'd be happy to contribute data to that end, as I'm sure many of us would."
Q2,"Please provide further explanation on ""nesting.""  Nesting of what?  Bees?  How so?  I'm confused."
Q2,I am a participant in Beescape from  over a year ago and want to offer feedback that while the system is showing that Fall is my worst honey flow it is actually 2x better than spring or summer unlike what this system is showing.  I pull one super for spring and summer and 2 for Fall.  
Q2,"It would have been helpful if I had reviewed the video before starting this survey. I also don't think i got log in information to submit the survey results from my apiary, but I'm going to try to do it anyway. 
This is a great tool for people who aren't sure where to put an apiary. Mine is in my backyard, so, no decision there. "
Q2,"I have only one hive and have only one place, my yard, to locate that hive. I also am not interested in honey production for collecting. Thus, my use of this tool would be very limited if there were only the original two extensions.  "
Q2,collect email addresses to then send updates for any significant changes to your baseline category scores

Q2,"This is a really, really great tool. I'd love to have broader regional coverage and more detailed seasonal information. Some insight into why the scores are as they are, and if possible some sense of trends or changes in the scores. I may be wrong but the scores for my 265 Port Royal Rd, Philadelphia, PA apiary seem higher than they were the last time I looked. Right now it's very useful for planning where to put an apiary, and it's great. It would be interesting if it could evolve into something that supports management. I'd be happy to contribute data to that end, as I'm sure many of us would."
Q2,"Please provide further explanation on ""nesting.""  Nesting of what?  Bees?  How so?  I'm confused."
Q2,I am a participant in Beescape from  over a year ago and want to offer feedback that while the system is showing that Fall is my worst honey flow it is actually 2x better than spring or summer unlike what this system is showing.  I pull one super for spring and summer and 2 for Fall.  
Q2,"It would have been helpful if I had reviewed the video before starting this survey. I also don't think i got log in information to submit the survey results from my apiary, but I'm going to try to do it anyway. 
This is a great tool for people who aren't sure where to put an apiary. Mine is in my backyard, so, no decision there. "
Q2,"I have only one hive and have only one place, my yard, to locate that hive. I also am not interested in honey production for collecting. Thus, my use of this tool would be very limited if there were only the original two extensions.  "
Q2,collect email addresses to then send updates for any significant changes to your baseline category scores
Q2,I thought it was a great experience.
Q2,No.
Q1,I would like to see verora mite populations in the area along with other diseases.  Pest and disease management references would also be helpful.
Q1,None that I can think of
Q1,"Group cropping items into clusters of comparable forage quality and code similarly. There are too many categories, and they are not, in any case, accurate in any detail.  Fix the scoring; high should be greater or equal not less or equal. A link to paragraphs that explain the criteria that result in a particular scoring would be most useful. "
Q1,"I'm not sure how the scores are calculated, which leads me to how much I trust the values. The floral scores are important but I would argue the pesticide usage is the most important value to myself. I don't see how this can be accurate. How does beescapes know what chemicals my neighbor is spraying on his yard, it doesn't..."
Q1,"Ability to share information with nearby beekeepers.  For example, regarding bee health, whether or not pollen is being brought in, honey production levels, etc."
Q1,I live in Connecticut so please add my state to Beescape soon.
Q1,"Glossary - what does ""Nesting"" mean in this context? Hollow trees?
The crop cover information is difficult to interpret. Too many of the colors are similar and there's no textual information on the map. Also, the information for the Penn State farm throws the quality of the data into question."
Q1,"I have a hard time distinguishing some of the colors in the crop layer.  I live in a rural/agricultural area, so there's a lot of farms and plant life nearby.  I would love for the crops either to be identified explicitly on the map or the colors to differ enough that I actually know what's available in my area."
Q1,my computer does not allow for drag and click so reording the above preferences was not possible
Q1,"A key for the map that explains what the other blue dots are. 
A layer that shows Spotted Lanternfly infestations, as our bees may be ingesting the honeydew. "
Q1,"I understand that this is in its infancy and will be expanded.  It was interesting to see the results for the categories.  However, there was no explanation of what the categories meant so it was not as useful as it might be if I had more information.  Other extensions would make it a much more useful tool."
Q1,"give more explanation for definitions of each category, including types of insecticides being monitored or included in the data"
Q1,I don't think there's anything wrong with it. I lked it.
Q1,I think the programs's great. I think it will be easier for most beekeeprs.
Q2,I learned that my hive location is better than what I expected.  I thought there was a higher insecticide risk than what was displayed and there was better forage than what I thought.
Q2,"I think this tool has a lot of promise.  The problem is that my apiary is stationary and I don't know of any way to develop an out yard.  For me, once I determine the scores and potentially what I can do to maximize them, I probably won't return to this web site.  That's because the data, for me, will not change.  Therefore, the tool is great.  You just need to determine how to make it more than just a ""one and done"" experience."
Q2,Very easy survey to complete.  I have a much better understanding of the information available through Beescape.
Q2,I would have enjoyed it more if it were for my location.
Q2,"Realize that most of us don't have the option of moving our apiary. This is why I would likely not consult the map often. Also, cropping on a lot of land changes either over the course of a summer or over the course of a few years as many farmers practice rotations."
Q2,"Overall I think this a useful tool. I don't know the evaluation process and how the ""scores"" are vetted for accuracy but I can see this being useful for people that have a range the can select for a hive location. However, MOST people that have <5 acres of ground probably get the same score regardless of the location they select, it just wouldn't be enough area."
